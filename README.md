## History

[Nebraska](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625141625/http://www.unitedthemes.com/nebraska-responsive-multi-purpose-theme/), also known as _Nebraska – Responsive Multi-Purpose Theme_, was a WordPress theme developed by [UnitedThemes™](https://unitedthemes.com/), published January 30, 2013. It was one of the top themes on [Envato ThemeForest](https://web.archive.org/web/20200223145353/http://themeforest.net/item/nebraska-responsive-multipurpose-theme/3885811?ref=UnitedThemes), until it was [discontinued](http://themeforest.net/item/nebraska-responsive-multipurpose-theme/3885811) in 2015. The last version was the 1.3.7, released August 28, 2015.

## Nebraska Fixed

The purpose of this project is to make Nebraska theme works with the current version of WordPress and a recent version of PHP. I tested it with **WordPress 6.1.1** and **PHP 7.4.28**, but it probably supports different versions too: just give it a try.

Nebraska Fixed is built upon Nebraska 1.3.2 (framework version 2.1).

Beside the compatibility, the fixed version contains various improvements:

- fixed pre-existing bugs
- patched security issues
- changed the admin menu icons
- added new socials (WhatsApp, Maps)
- improved the code readability
- updated some libraries
- removed Shockwave Flash
- removed useless files

Be careful: it is not suggested using it as your WordPress theme, because it still relays on old plugins and libraries.


## Installation

Simply overwrite your previous Nebraska installation, usually in `wp-content/themes/nebraska`, with the fixed version. Backup first!
